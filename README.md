## Contents
This repository contains the following files:
### NVGcode.m
- In Matlab.
- Encodes the time series (sequence) into the natural visibility graph series. (For any provided motif size.)
- Using the maximum slope idea, a little bit faster than the direct processing. Still O(n^2).

### HVGcode.m
- In Matlab.
- Encodes the time series (sequence) into the horizontal visibility graph series. (For any provided motif size.)
- Using the maximum slope idea, a little bit faster than the direct processing. Still O(n^2).

### NVGcode_DC.m
- In Matlab.
- Encodes the time series (sequence) into the natural visibility graph series. (For any provided motif size.)
- Using the "divide and concur" idea, O(NlogN). Details refer to [Fast transformation from time series to visibility graphs](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4927835).

### NVGcode_DC.py
- In python.
- Encodes the time series (sequence) into the natural visibility graph series. (For any provided motif size.)
- Using the "divide and concur" idea, O(NlogN). Details refer to [Fast transformation from time series to visibility graphs](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4927835).
